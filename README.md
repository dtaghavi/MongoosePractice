# MongoosePractice
Here is a Mongoose Practice project. In it I have practiced using all C.R.U.D functions using Mongoose.

NOTE: Not a stand alone workable project.

In the app.js I was practicing all the different CRUD functions using mongoose.

If you want to check them out I have left them in there and commented out different parts as I was going.
